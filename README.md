# Simple Shopping Cart

A simple shopping cart application built with React, utilizing Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling. The app allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, view the cart's contents, and adjust item quantities. Tailwind CSS provides a responsive, clean design, while DaisyUI components enhance the user interface with ready-made UI elements like buttons and cards. The project demonstrates React's state management for handling the cart and updating the UI dynamically.
